# Effect data and pure transformations

Use this skill for values and pure transformations, not for service
composition. It covers Option, Data, Equal, Equivalence, Order, Ordering,
Predicate, Filter, Match, Brand, Newtype, Redacted, Array, Iterable,
NonEmptyIterable, Chunk, HashMap, HashSet, mutable collections, Record,
Struct, Tuple, String, Number, BigInt, BigDecimal, Boolean, RegExp, Symbol,
Trie, Graph, Reducer, Differ, Combiner, and JSON pointer/patch helpers.

## Choose the representation

- Option means absence is expected; Result means a value-level operation
  failed; Effect means the operation has execution, resources, or services.
- Data and Equal define structural equality; Brand and Newtype add domain
  distinctions without changing runtime representation.
- HashMap and HashSet are immutable; use mutable variants only at an explicit
  local boundary.
- NonEmptyIterable and tuple types preserve invariants that an Array cannot.
- Match is useful for exhaustive tagged values; do not replace it with a
  chain of unchecked casts.

## Make absence and variants explicit

```ts
import { Number as EffectNumber, Option, Result } from "effect"

declare const maybeUser: { readonly name: string } | null | undefined
declare const text: string

const label = Option.fromNullable(maybeUser).pipe(
  Option.map((user) => user.name),
  Option.getOrElse(() => "anonymous")
)

const parsed = Result.fromOption(
  EffectNumber.parse(text),
  () => "invalid-number" as const
)
```

Convert null and undefined once at the boundary. Never read a value from an
Option or Result before matching it. Native `Number.parseInt` returns `NaN` when
there is no numeric prefix, accepts partial numeric prefixes, and does not
throw, so it is not a validation boundary for `Result.try`; use `Number.parse`
when invalid numeric text should be explicit.

## Pure collection review

Prefer pipe-friendly, data-last combinators and avoid accidental mutation.
Check whether an operation preserves ordering, allocates a new collection,
requires a non-empty input, or changes equality semantics. Use Chunk when a
pipeline needs efficient immutable batches; use Stream when values are
incremental or unbounded.

Brands and refinements should be created at the boundary that proves them.
Keep the constructor private to a module when an invariant must not be forged
by callers.

## Common mistakes

- Using Option as a catch-all error channel.
- Mutating an object stored inside a Ref or HashMap.
- Comparing records with JavaScript identity when structural equality is
  required.
- Treating a hash collection's iteration order as a persistence contract.
- Making a Brand that has no runtime validation or documented proof.
