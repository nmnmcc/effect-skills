# Durable workflows

Use `effect/unstable/workflow` when a named execution needs an engine-owned
identity and result across process lifetimes. A normal Effect or forked fiber
does not gain durability from a retry policy. v4 rc.117 workflow APIs are
unstable; read the installed declarations before upgrading or porting v3.

## Choose an engine-visible boundary

- Define payload, success, and error schemas and a stable idempotency key on
  `Workflow`. Execute or poll through `WorkflowEngine`.
- Put a named external action in `Activity`: its encoded exit is replayed.
  Use `DurableClock` or `DurableDeferred` for suspension that the engine can
  observe; use `DurableQueue` for worker handoff.
- A memory engine is a test fixture, not a restart-surviving deployment.
  Back the engine and queue with persistent storage and plan schema upgrades.

```ts
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"
import { Activity, Workflow } from "effect/unstable/workflow"

const Charge = Activity.make({
  name: "billing.charge",
  success: Schema.Void,
  error: Schema.String,
  execute: Effect.succeed(undefined)
})

const Billing = Workflow.make("billing.run", {
  payload: { id: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.Void,
  error: Schema.String,
  idempotencyKey: ({ id }) => id
})

const BillingLayer = Billing.toLayer(() => Charge.execute)
```

Replay can repeat the workflow body around suspension. Use a business-level
idempotency key or outbox for an external charge; an activity name alone does
not guarantee exactly-once delivery. Scope worker and engine layers for
shutdown and map their operational failures at the API boundary.

## Adjacent responsibilities

RPC defines a typed remote protocol, Cluster owns sharded entities, EventLog
owns append-only facts, and Persistence provides stores and queues. Use SQL
when application records and transactions need a relational database rather
than a workflow execution log.
