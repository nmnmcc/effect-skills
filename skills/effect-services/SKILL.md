# Effect services and resource graphs

This skill covers service-first design: Context tags define capabilities,
Layers assemble implementations, and Scope owns resources. Use it for
dependency injection, provider composition, startup/shutdown, and test
doubles.

## Version gate

Confirm whether the project uses v3 or the published `4.0.0-rc.117` before
copying a Tag or Layer signature. Read the installed declarations; npm's
`latest` is v3 and upstream `main` is newer than the pinned release.

## Design the service first

Keep a service interface small and application-shaped. A Context Service is a
typed key, not a singleton implementation. The service should expose Effects
for operations that can fail or need other services.

```ts
import { Context, Effect } from "effect"

type User = { readonly id: string; readonly name: string }

class UserRepo extends Context.Service<UserRepo, {
    readonly find: (id: string) => Effect.Effect<User, "NotFound">
}>()("UserRepo") {}

const loadName = (id: string) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const repo = yield* UserRepo
    const user = yield* repo.find(id)
    return user.name
  })
```

Keep the repository error type visible. Do not hide a missing service with a
cast: the R parameter should tell the caller which Layer is still required.

## Build the Layer graph

1. Use Layer.succeed for a pure implementation.
2. Use Layer.effect when constructing a service needs other services.
3. Use Layer.scoped for clients, sockets, pools, and anything with a
   finalizer.
4. Compose with Layer.merge or Layer.provide; keep the graph close to the
   application composition root.
5. Build one ManagedRuntime for a long-lived process and close it at shutdown.

```ts
import { Context, Effect, Layer } from "effect"

class Config extends Context.Service<Config, {
  readonly apiUrl: string
}>()("Config") {}

const configLayer = Layer.succeed(Config, { apiUrl: "https://api.example" })

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const config = yield* Config
  return config.apiUrl
}).pipe(Effect.provide(configLayer))
```

Read Layer types as Layer<ROut, E, RIn>: what it provides, how construction
can fail, and what it still requires. A graph that is type-safe can still be
wrong if it creates a new database client per request.

## Scoped resources

Use acquireRelease or Layer.scoped for ownership. Verify that release runs on
normal completion, typed failure, and interruption. When replacing a resource
through ScopedRef or LayerRef, define whether the old value is closed before
the new one becomes visible.

## Review checklist

- Is the Tag interface independent of the concrete SDK?
- Are credentials read through Config and kept out of logs?
- Are stateful Layers memoized at the right Scope?
- Does shutdown dispose the ManagedRuntime and close pools and listeners?
- Do tests replace providers with deterministic Layers rather than monkey
  patching globals?

## Boundaries

Use Effect core for error semantics, Scope for finalizers, Config for input,
and platform-specific skills for concrete providers. Do not invent an adapter
when an @effect/platform-*, SQL, HTTP, or AI package already owns the Layer.
