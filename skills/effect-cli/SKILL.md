# Effect CLI

Use `effect/unstable/cli` for command trees and typed flags. Keep parsing in
`Command` and `Flag`, domain operations in services, and process signals and
exit codes at the platform run boundary. Check the consuming project's
installed version: this entrypoint exists in v4 rc.117, not v3.

## A command boundary

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { Command, Flag } from "effect/unstable/cli"

const port = Flag.Int("port").pipe(Flag.withDefault(8080))
const serve = Command.make("serve", { port }).pipe(
  Command.withHandler(({ port }) => Effect.logInfo(`listening on ${port}`))
)

const cli = Command.run(serve, { version: "1.0.0" })
```

Supply terminal and runtime services at the outermost entrypoint; do not run
the command while defining it. Parse values before invoking a service, and
test argument errors separately from handler failures. A prompt needs an
explicit cancellation and non-TTY policy; never echo secrets.

## Adjacent responsibilities

Use Schema to validate complex input after parsing, Config for deployment
settings, and platform services for files and process lifecycle. Doctest
belongs with testing; OpenAPI generation belongs with a typed HTTP API, not
with CLI handlers.
