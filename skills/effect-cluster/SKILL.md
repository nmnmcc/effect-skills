# Effect cluster

Use `effect/cluster` when a message needs an entity owner chosen by
sharding. An ordinary RPC request does not need a cluster. This v4 API is
unstable and incompatible with v3 cluster package examples.

## Entity and deployment boundary

Define serializable requests with RPC schemas, implement them as entity
handlers, and supply Sharding, runner, storage, and transport layers at the
deployment boundary. Ownership can move: interruption, mailbox capacity,
redelivery, and idempotency are part of the contract. Singleton ownership
means one active runner, not that an external action occurs exactly once.

```ts
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"
import { Entity, ShardingConfig } from "effect/cluster"
import { Rpc } from "effect/rpc"

const Account = Entity.make("Account", [
  Rpc.make("balance", {
    payload: { accountId: Schema.String },
    success: Schema.Number,
    error: Schema.Literal("missing")
  })
])

const AccountLayer = Account.toLayer({
  balance: ({ payload }) =>
    payload.accountId === "closed"
      ? Effect.fail("missing" as const)
      : Effect.succeed(100)
})

const testCall = Effect.scoped(Effect.gen(function* () {
  const makeClient = yield* Entity.makeTestClient(Account, AccountLayer)
  const client = yield* makeClient("account-42")
  return yield* client.balance({ accountId: "account-42" })
})).pipe(Effect.provide(ShardingConfig.layerDefaults))
```

The test client exercises handlers, not network delivery or runner failover.
For deployment, test reassignment, interruption, and persisted message
storage separately. RPC owns procedure contracts and transport serialization;
Workflow owns durable executions, while Cluster only assigns entity owners.
